A begin with a little lie: it's much more day 2, 3, and 4 than a single
day... Also, there's not any page count this time, as I switched back from
learning from a single book (Programming Forth) to flutter around several of
them, as it fits better into my learning style.

As a little exercice, I did a little + or - guessing game in Forth. It was a
really good experience! Apart from the joys of mental exercice which go hand in
hand with new concepts, I really liked the expressiveness. As there's no need to
have explicit arguments, after some (re)factoring (thanks /r/forth!) everything
feels clearer.

Next steps; all the fun stuff: IMMEDIATE, POSTPONE, CREATE DOES>...
